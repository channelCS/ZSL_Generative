# ZSL_Generative
An open source Zero Shot Classification toolbox based on PyTorch.

# Installation
The model is built in PyTorch 1.6.0 and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 environment (Python3.7, CUDA11.0, cuDNN7.5).

For installing, follow these intructions
```
conda create -n pytorch160 python=3.7
conda activate pytorch160
conda install pytorch=1.6 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data preparation
For downloading `v1` version of CUB, AWA2, FLO and SUN features use `download.sh` inside datasets/v1 folder.
```
cd datasets/v1; sh download.sh; cd ../../
```

For downloading `v2` version of CUB, AWA2, and SUN features use `download.sh` inside datasets/v2 folder.  
**[Note]:** `v2` version was recently released to fix a test data leaking bug.
```
cd datasets/v2; sh download.sh; cd ../../
```

# Training and Evaluation
## Zero-Shot Image Classification
To train and evaluate ZSL and GZSL models on `v1` version of CUB, AWA2, FLO and SUN, please run:
```
CUB: python train_images.py -opt options/Tfvaegan/CUB.yml
AWA2: python train_images.py -opt options/Tfvaegan/AWA2.yml
FLO: python train_images.py -opt options/Tfvaegan/FLO.yml
SUN: python train_images.py -opt options/Tfvaegan/SUN.yml

```

To train and evaluate ZSL and GZSL models on `v2` version of CUB, AWA2, and SUN, edit configuration file.
```yml
version: v2
```
# Wandb Logger

[wandb](https://www.wandb.com/) can be viewed as a cloud version of tensorboard. One can easily view training processes and curves in wandb.  
To enable wandb logging edit the configuration file.

```yml
wandb: True
```
